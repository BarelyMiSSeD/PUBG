# PUBG calc_rank.py

This is a python 3 program for doing solo match custom game tournaments.<br>

It allows for games to be played when people can get enough players together.<br>
A match is then entered into the program and it will spit out a player rankings based on their ELO.<br>

We have players post a screenshot of the end game scoreboard into a discord channel and one person is responsible for entering the games, in order, and posting the new ratings.<br>

It has a minimum games to qualify setting that will score show the players who have qualified and the ones who have not yet qualified.<br>
This way games do not have to be at set times or with set players.<br>
The tournament starts everyone at the default rating, 1500 is what I entered, and adjusts based on performance.
